[ DCB ID: 7 | Status: Disassembled | Location: UMD | Fused: yes | PRBS:  | 1.5V Test: N/A | 2.5V Test: N/A ]
Comment: TP5 to backplate res < 1ohm, caused power to shut off when fusing; Took apart applied more thermal paste then reassembled, found a scratch on the back of the DCB and a bent pin on the master optical mezzanine slot; Succeeded in fusing board.  Returning to manufacturer to fix bent pin (J7, pin 58)
